In this study, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model for 
evaluating the price based on the factors that affect the price. Modeling explorations apply some 
regression techniques such as multiple linear regression (Least Squares), Lasso and Ridge 
regression models, support vector regression, and boosting algorithms such as Extreme Gradient 
Boost Regression (XG Boost)
